                    not over the set of individual transformations of the current
                    feasible solution but over a set of sequences of transformations
                This leads us to define two local search algorithms for the NL-LMP.
                Our C++ implementation computes cost differences incrementally and solves the optimization 
                    problem over transformations by means of a priority queue

                five orders of magnitude faster than B&C.
                KLj/r and KLj∗r have lower cost and higher applicationspecific accuracy (Acc) on average
                The shorter absolute running time of KLj/r and KLj∗r allows us to increase the number of nodes from 150, as in [13], to 420

                We have shown applications of these algorithms to the tasks of articulated human body pose estimation
                We conclude that the NL-LMP is a useful mathematical abstraction in the field of computer vision

                A Numerically Robust LCP Solver for Simulating Articulated Rigid Bodies in Contact
                    http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss04/p12.pdf
                    numerically robust algorithm  for solving linear complementarity problems (LCPs)
                    articulated rigid bodies
                    Constraint-based approaches often employ linear complementarity problem (LCP)
                    Most models can  be categorized into penalty- and constraint-based methods
                    Modeling collisions and contacts
                    contact forces are easily computed from penetration depths  and relative velocities
                    the approach suffers from numerical  instability problem due to impulsive forces
                    linear complementarity problem (LCP) [1] to formulate the constraints.
                    LCPs can be solved by either iterative or pivot-based  approach
                    numerical root-finding  techniques such as Newton’s method to find the equilibrium.
                    Pivot-based approaches are theoretically  guaranteed to find a solution with finite number of trials
                    for general problems
                    However, it is known  that pivot-based approaches often suffer from numerical problem especially for large-scale and/or ill-conditioned problems
                    Jourdan et al. [4] applied an iterative  LCP solver similar to Gauss-Seidel algorithm
                    proved convergence in most  practical cases.
                    free rigid bodies,  in which case M is generally sparse and the LCP is likely  to be relatively easily solved by both iterative and pivot-based  approaches
                    iterative methods do not guarantee convergence to a  solution
                    The main contribution of this paper is improvement of  Lemke Algorithm to deal with large-scale and ill-conditioned  LCPs derived from frictional contacts between articulated  rigid bodies of arbitrary geometry

                            it is similar to cook torrance brdf model but features at computing speed, improtance sampling support 
                            In order to keep the resulting formulae simple, several approximations are made.
                            the results are generalized and simplified with the aim of allowing

                            the amount varies as a function of wavelength
                        for production (film and game) rendering, RGB triples are used instead.
                        it is convenient to have all vectors point away from the surface
                        * The surface’s response to  light is quantified by a function called the BRDF
                        qq brdf is the surface’s response to light?
                        Each direction (incoming and outgoing) can be parameterized with two numbers (e.g. polar coordinates), 
		                    so the overall dimensionality of the BRDF is four 
                        qq what are isotropic BRDFs?
                            rotating the [light and view directions] around [the surface normal] 
                                does not affect the BRDF.
                        parameter becomes three in the case of isotropic BRDFs
                        t is a tangent vector defining a preferred direction over the surface 
                            (this is only used for anisotropic BRDFs,
                        * Avoiding back-facing light directions
                            is straightforward
                        qq how can we set the light contributions from any back-facing  direction to zero?
                        can be avoided by clamping n·v to 0
                        * over all directions above the surface
                        continuous  weighted average. 
                        qq why we use component-wise vector multiplication here? in computing reflection? 
                        both BRDF and light color are spectral (RGB) vectors
                        the BRDF gives the relative contribution of light from  each incoming direction to the outgoing light.
                        swapped
                        Energy conservation refers to the fact that a surface cannot reflect more than 100% of incoming light  energy.
                        must not exceed 1.
                        The vector halfway between l and v is  called the half-vector or half-angle vector ; we will denote it as h.
                        the denominator 4(n · l)(n · v) is * a correction factor
                        macrosurface
                        we can think of this value (which we will denote F0) as the characteristic specular reflectance  of the material.
                        qq Limitations of the Microfacet Model?
                            The microfacet model does not take account of pronounced wave optics 
                                effects such as diffraction  and interference.
                            the microfacet model is based on a relatively limited model of the surface microgeometry, 
                                with several unstated assumptions.
                            However, this assumption is not always true
                        This formulation of microfacet theory is quite powerful and flexible
                        If these are important, then modifications or  extensions to the model may be required. 
                        the definition of the normal distribution function
                        This is equivalent to assuming that microgeometry height and normal are uncorrelated 
                        A surface with a strong correlation between height and orientation
                        is the best-understood and most successful tool

                        radiosity has been extended with directional capabilities
                        qq what is a radiosity algorithm? 
                            radiosity is an application of the finite element method to solving the rendering equation 
                                for scenes with surfaces that reflect light diffusely.
                            Unlike rendering methods that use Monte Carlo algorithms (such as path tracing), 
                                which handle all types of light paths, typical radiosity only account for paths 
                                    (represented by the code "LD*E") 
                            Radiosity is a global illumination algorithm in the sense that the illumination 
                                arriving on a surface comes not just directly from the light sources, 
                                    but also from other surfaces reflecting light. 
                            Radiosity is viewpoint independent
                            the scene can be baked
                            linear system can be driven

                        which increases the calculations involved
                        Radiosity methods were first developed in about 1950 in the engineering field of heat transfer. 
                        Notable commercial radiosity engines are Enlighten by Geomerics
                        accounted for diffuse indirect lighting.
                        In this context, radiosity is the total radiative flux (both reflected and re-radiated) leaving a surface
                        as radiant exitance.
                        Calculation of radiosity, rather than surface temperatures, is a key aspect of the radiosity method that permits linear matrix methods to be applied to the problem.
                        multiple bounces are computed
                        Individual patches are visible as squares on the walls and floor.

                        radiosity algorithm is performed on a simple geometric approximation of the original model.
                        a two pass method in which we simplify the representation  of the illumination instead of simplifying the geometry
                        we store incoming flux (photons)
                        The use of photons allows us to estimate surface radiance at surfaces with  arbitrary BRDF’s
                        situations where we need an accurate  computation and situations in which an approximate estimate can be applied
                        For highly glossy surfaces  we do however trace additional sample rays since reasonable radiance estimates  for these surfaces require a large number of photons.
                        using a separate caustics photon map which has a high  density of photons.
                        The caustics photon map is used only to store  photons corresponding to caustics
                        created by emitting photons towards the  specular objects in the scene and storing these as they hit diffuse surfaces.
                        this requires a high density of photons.
                        The global photon map is used as a rough approximation of the light/flux within  the scene
                        and at the following intersection points  we store shadow photons.
                        improved both the speed,  reduced the memory requirements and improved the accuracy of the method
                        The photons are stored in a balanced kd-tree
                        The fact that the tree is balanced guarantees that the time it  takes to locate M photons in a tree with N photons is O(M · log2(N))
                        The final image is rendered using Monte Carlo ray tracing
                        while the specular part are highly glossy and ideal specular reflection  models 
                        Lr, depends on the radiance values in the rest of the scene and it can  be solved directly using Monte Carlo techniques like path tracing.
                        We distinguish between two different evaluations of the integrals: An accurate and  an approximate
                        (it contributes only  little to the pixel radiance
                        The approximate evaluation is simply the radiance estimate obtained from the  global photon map

                            * The rendering equation (1) can be split into a sum of several components.
                                and the reflection part can be splited to four parts
                                    the method used to evaluate each part depends on wheather we want to evaluate it in accurate 
                                        way or approximate take a look at the direct light part, 
                                            radiance estimate can be taken directly from global photon map(approximation ) or 
                                                perform light source evaluations! 
                        qq how can evaluate Caustics part of the reflected integral? 
                            represents caustics on diffuse and slightly glossy surfaces
                            evaluate this term using the information in the caustics photon map
                            the radiance estimate based on the caustics photon map is visualized directly
                            number of photons in the caustics photon map must be high.
                        The information in the photon map can be used to compute the radiance leaving a
                            surface in a given direction
                        An alternative could be using a sphere of a fixed size and use all the photons  within this sphere
                        considered a number of adaptive strategies for computing the necessary size of the  sphere based on the local photon density.

                        Comparisons  with existing global illumination techniques indicate that 
                            the photon map provides an efficient environment for global illumination.
                        qq the photon map structure is completely separated from the geometric representation? how to understand this?
                        The photon map code can be provided in a separate module that contains the necessary 
                            functions (e.g. a function that given a position and a surface definition returns the  
                            radiance in a given direction).

                            Monte Carlo ray tracing methods includes: path tracing, bidirectional path tracing, and Metropolis light transport.
                        Photon mapping is significantly better at capturing the caustics lighting seen through the lamp
                            it is cache based method!

                        unbiased Monte Carlo ray tracing methods such as path tracing
                        Progressive photon mapping uses multiple photon tracing steps to compute an 
                            accurate solution without maintaining  every photons from each iteration.
                        qq what is the biggest advantage of progressive photon mapping?? 
                            * Arbitry accuracy can be achieved by a limited memory consumption, when it compared to traditional photon mapping methods 
                            Each photon tracing pass results in an increasingly accurate global illumination  solution
                            any desired accuracy can be reached using a limited amount of memory. 
                        qq what is Progressive Radiance Estimate
                        To address the shortcomings of BDPT Veach and Guibas [1997]  proposed the Metropolis light transport algorithm
                        qq In MLT,  each path is generated based on?
                            the mutation (perturbation) of a  previous path. 
                        illumination coming through a slight opening of  door.
                        such paths are difficult to generate by mutating existing paths.
                        improvement to MLT called Energy Redistribution Path Tracing (ERPT)
                        it shares the same weakness in the context of mirror reflections of caustics.
                        Path  space is the space of all possible light transport paths in a scene
                        Note that path tracing, BDPT, MLT,  ERPT and PMC-ER are all unbiased path-space based methods

                            > connecting paths from the  eye to the light? 
                        photon mapping is very effective at rendering SDS  paths
                        qq the final quality of PM is often limited by?
                            the maximum number of photons
                        Havran et al. introduced the concept of reverse photon mapping [Havran et al. 2005].
                        ray tracing in the first pass and photon tracing in the second pass.
                        The motivation for this approach is to reduce  the complexity and improve the performance of photon mapping

                        Our method also uses the number of photons to reduce the search radius of the radiance  estimate
                        With progressive photon mapping we can use an unlimited number of photons, since we do not need to store all the photons  and we retain all the advantages of the standard photon mapping  method
                        being able to handle non-Lambertian surfaces.

                            use an infinite number of photons in the photon map
                            the radius should converge to zero.

                        Progressive photon mapping [Hachisuka et al. 2008] removed the  memory bound of photon mapping, 
                            which makes the results converge to the correct solutions 
                                (i.e., bias goes to zero in the limit).

                        improves its robustness to an even wider class of scene settings.
                        We are not aware of existing work in density estimation literatures outside graphics

                        qq how can we model motion blur and depth of field in GI algos? x2 
                            motion blur requires computing the average  radiance value over a 
                            visible part of a scene for a given shutter time,  
                            and depth-of-field needs the average radiance value over a part of  scene that is visible through a lens
                        the original progressive radiance estimate is restricted to computing  the correct radiance value at a point ~x.
                        shared statistics over a region that we would like  to compute the average radiance value for
                        over the region
                        Figure 2 summarizes the difference between the algorithms of progressive photon  mapping and our algorithm
                        the modification is simple
