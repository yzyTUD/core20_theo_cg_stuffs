                This problem offers a common
                    mathematical abstraction of seemingly unrelated computer
                    vision tasks
                instance-separating semantic segmentation, articulated human body pose
                    estimation and multiple object tracking

                    decide whether this point depicts an object or background
                    For every pair of points that depict objects, one needs to decide if the object is the same

                solution in LMP  is also in NL-LMP 
                q- local search algo for compute feasible solutions of the NL-LMP efficiently
                s- DeeperCut: A deeper, stronger, and faster multiperson pose estimation model.
                a local search is carried out
                    not over the set of individual transformations of the current
                    feasible solution but over a set of sequences of transformations
                This leads us to define two local search algorithms for the NL-LMP.
                Our C++ implementation computes cost differences incrementally and solves the optimization 
                    problem over transformations by means of a priority queue
                The time and space complexities are identical to those of KLj and are established in

                s- find some code imp. the benchmarks! 
                s- find soluitons for typical vision tasks, esp. for these three distinct computer vision tasks
                we set up instances of the NL-LMP from published data
                Convergence of B&C, KLj/r and KLj∗r in an application to the task of articulated human body pose estimation.
                s- Convergence graph plot 
                we compare the convergence
                arrive at near optimal feasible
                    solutions after 10−1 seconds
                five orders of magnitude faster than B&C.
                KLj/r and KLj∗r have lower cost and higher applicationspecific accuracy (Acc) on average
                The shorter absolute running time of KLj/r and KLj∗r allows us to increase the number of nodes from 150, as in [13], to 420
                table, ... 
                We have defined and implemented two local search algorithms, KLj/r
                    and KLj∗r
                converge monotonously to a local optimum
                We have shown applications of these algorithms to the tasks of articulated human body pose estimation
                We conclude that the NL-LMP is a useful mathematical abstraction in the field of computer vision
