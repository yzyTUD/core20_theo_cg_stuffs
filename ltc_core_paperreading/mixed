            *Manipulating Puppets in VR
                https://conferences.computer.org/vr-tvcg/2020/pdfs/VR2020-2f8MzUJjtCXG6Ue9RYFSN2/560800a010/560800a010.pdf
                *Interaction paradigms
                effective interaction design to support  creative engagement
                the format transcends  cultural, racial, or educational boundarie
                transmedia practices
                Puppetry has been used  both to question and challenge social conditions
                whether experts of  puppetry will perceive interaction with a puppetry-based VR  interface differently than non-experts.
            *Investigating Bubble Mechanism for Ray-Casting to  
                Improve 3D Target Acquisition in Virtual Reality  
                    investigate a bubble mechanism for ray-casting in virtual  reality
                bubble mechanism
                do not have to accurately shoot through the target
                visual feedback
                simple and complicated  3D target acquisition tasks
                y improves ray-casting on both performance and preference
                Human-centered computing
                Interaction design
                Target acquisition is one of the most elementary interactions 
                designing virtual reality games and tools.
                However, ray-casting  will be unstable when selecting small and distant targets
