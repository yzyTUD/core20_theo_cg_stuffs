            *Interaction paradigms
            effective interaction design to support  creative engagement
            the format transcends  cultural, racial, or educational boundarie
            transmedia practices
            Puppetry has been used  both to question and challenge social conditions
            whether experts of  puppetry will perceive interaction with a puppetry-based VR  interface differently than non-experts.
        *Investigating Bubble Mechanism for Ray-Casting to  
            Improve 3D Target Acquisition in Virtual Reality  
                investigate a bubble mechanism for ray-casting in virtual  reality
            bubble mechanism
            do not have to accurately shoot through the target
            visual feedback
            simple and complicated  3D target acquisition tasks
            y improves ray-casting on both performance and preference
            Human-centered computing
            Interaction design
            Target acquisition is one of the most elementary interactions 
            designing virtual reality games and tools.
            However, ray-casting  will be unstable when selecting small and distant targets
