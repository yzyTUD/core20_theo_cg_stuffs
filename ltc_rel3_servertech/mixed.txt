            FFmpeg
                一款多媒体视频处理工具，有非常强大的功能包括视频采集功能、视频格式转换、视频抓图、给视频加水印等

                ffmpeg is a very fast video and audio converter that can also grab from a live audio/video source
                input "files" (which can be regular files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.)
                Selecting which streams from which inputs will go into which output is either done automatically or with the -map option
                2:3 refers to the fourth stream in the third input file. Also see the Stream specifiers chapter
                q- To force the frame rate of the output file to 24 fps? 
                    ffmpeg -i input.avi -r 24 output.avi
                q- transcoding process with a pic?
                h- ffmpeg calls the libavformat library (containing demuxers) to read input files and get 
                    packets containing encoded data 
                q- what libs does ffmpeg relaies on? 
                h- The decoder produces uncompressed frames (raw video/PCM audio/...) which can be processed further by filtering (see next section)
                Finally those are passed to the muxer, which writes the encoded packets to the output file.
                q- the detailed transcoding process 
                ffmpeg can process raw audio and video frames using filters from the libavfilter library
                Several chained filters form a filter graph
                q- what is a filter graph?
                Stream copy is a mode selected by supplying the copy parameter to the -codec option
                q- what means stream copy? 
                    does only demuxing and muxing.
                    modifying container-level metadata.
                    it is very fast and there is no quality loss
                q- can we apply filter in steam copy mode? n 
                    filters work on uncompressed data.
                q- some para. 
                    -y Overwrite output files without asking. 
                    -f Force input or output file format. 
                    stream_specifier stream_type is one of following: ’v’ or ’V’ for video, ’a’ for audio, ’s’ for subtitle, ’d’ for data, and ’t’ for attachments
                    ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy OUTPUT
                many video, audio options exist 
                Uses the dshow (DirectShow) input device which is the preferred option for Windows users
                streaming 
                Point to point streaming
                    If you want to stream "from one computer to another", you could start up a server on one, and then stream from FFmpeg to that server,

            mjpeg 是motion jpeg协议
                MJPEG is the compilation of separately compressed JPEGs in a sequence, which 
                    leads to high quality outcome in terms of resolution.
                can save a significant amount of bandwidth compared to MJPEG (which encodes 
                    each frame as new), but results in a video of lower quality.
            Using VLC transcode Video RTSP stream to MJPEG
            MJPEG Server implements MJPEG over HTTP using FFmpeg or any other input source capable 
                of piping a multipart JPEG stream to stdout.
            providing screen recordings for remote Webdriver tests
            The more robust ffmpeg-server also provides M-JPEG streaming support.
            video-capture devices such as digital cameras, IP cameras, and webcams, 
                as well as by non-linear video editing systems
            webrtc 
                there is a configurable webrtc streamer, you just have to edit the web page to achieve the streaming 
                and could be fast enough! 
                but: public ip!!?
