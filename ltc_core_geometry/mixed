                sampling density estimation 
                    sampling density ? is defined  as the minimum radius of a circle  in tangential space
                    Sampling density typically  varies over surface
                    can be estimeted from average  distance to 3rd up to sixth nearest  
                        neighbor points.

                    use the tailor series of ùëî(ùë•, ùë¶) around the 2D origin to
                        compute the curvature properties
                    Solve with weighted pseudo inverse or with SVD
