                    anatomia
                    The knee is one of the largest and most complex joints in the body
                    knee joins the thigh bone (femur) to the shin bone (tibia).
                    kneecap 
                    Ligaments join the knee bones and provide stability to the knee
                    The anterior cruciate ligament prevents the femur from sliding backward on      the tibia
                    The posterior cruciate ligament prevents the femur from sliding forward on      the tibia
                    The medial and lateral collateral ligaments prevent the femur from sliding side to side.
                    PCL (posterior cruciate ligament) strain or tear: PCL tears can cause pain,
                        swelling, and knee instability. These injuries are less common than ACL 
                        tears, and physical therapy (rather than surgery) is usually the best option
                    MCL (medial collateral ligament) strain or tear: This injury may cause pain and possible instability to the inner side of the knee.
                    Gout: A form of arthritis caused by buildup of uric acid crystals in a joint
                    Arthritis and Pseudogout
                    Knee osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and often affects the knees. Caused by aging and wear and tear    of cartilage, osteoarthritis symptoms may include knee pain, stiffness, and swelling.

                    为了防止自己的idea在论文被收录前被别人剽窃，我们会将预稿上传到arvix作为预收录，因此这就是个可以
                        证明论文原创性（上传时间戳）的文档收录网站。
                    也是为了竞争，谁的论文在arXiv 挂的早，谁就拥有了这个论文的权力。
                    是一个收集物理学、数学、计算机科学与生物学论文预印本的网站。
                    arXiv 原先是由物理学家保罗·金斯巴格在1991年建立的网站，本意在收集物理学的论文预印本
                    目前的 arXiv 落脚于康乃尔大学
                    arXiv的存在是造就科学出版业中所谓开放获取运动的因素之一。现今的数学家及科学家习惯将其论文先上传至 arXiv.org
                    由于 arXiv 上的文章多半都会投稿到学术期刊，作者对文章多半保持严谨态度。少部分文章则一直保持预印本的形式，其中包括一些极具影响力的作品
                    arXiv 上的民间科学家作品为数不多，通常被归入“一般数学”（General Mathematics）项下。
                    有很好的paper，很novel的idea和fancy的模型，但也有未经过验证就摆上去的模型。所以在上面找计算机方面的文章还是需要经过一定的过滤。当然有固定的大牛或者单位发出的文章质量还是有保障。
                    arxiv最初是为了给物理和数学领域的研究者而开发的。因为他们领域审稿周期太长，所以就用arxiv来提前分享idea同时也可以给同行们一起来论道一下，结果来到CS就成了占坑了。
