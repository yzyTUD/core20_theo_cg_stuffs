	Connect to all neighbors within a sphere of fixed radius estimated from sampling density

	Estimation of sampling density
	&q how can we do this?
	most edges of an outlier point are outgoing and only few ingoing
	thresholding
	sampling density ? is defined as the minimum radius
	a circle in tangential space
	&q how those cpt are defined?
	Sampling is the process of converting a signal (e.g., a function of continuous time or space) into a numeric sequence
	analog-to-digital conversion
	or simply digitizing

	Problems of weighted Tanget Space Fit
	&q what are Problems of weighted Tanget Space Fit? op14
	To support sharp creases and corners, a second weight ???? is multiplied to the localization weight:
	Two choices have been proposed:
	The bilateral weights depend on the to be estimated normals and couple the local optimzation problems into a global, nonlinear optimization problem
	&h here, bilateral weighting actuall means : use a second weight! 
	compute bilateral weights
	fit tangential planes with new weights
	iterate
	&h for bilateral weights, typically we need to compute iter.

	consistent normal orientation is precondition of several surface reconstruction techniques
	Poisson Reconstruction
	&h here normal refers to point normal or surface normal? 
	angent plane fitting does not give sign of normal
	sign defines outside direction which needs to be globally consistent
	position of 3D scanner defines outside direction, but
	information is often lost 
	&q can we preserve the ori. by recording cam. loc. somehow? 
	normal orientation problem
	&q what is the output of normal orientation problem?
	estimate one or several normals from additional knowledge
	build neighbor graph and propagate normal orientation along graph edges
	normal orientation
	&t after 3d scan, write a prog. to fix normal orientation 
	&t check normal orientation of a scanned 3d dataset point cloud! 
	initialization: estimate one or several normals per connected component from additional knowledge
	outside direction of convex hull)
	&h we may know nothing about the normal dir. of a given point cloud 
	&q how can we estimate a initial step? op31 
	build neighbor graph (i.e. Riemann graph with ?? = 16)
