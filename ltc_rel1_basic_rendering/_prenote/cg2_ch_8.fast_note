		subdivision scheme: rule that maps polygon to a polygon with more points ? 
		subdivision step: one application of the subdivision rule ? 
		arity a: fraction of number of points after subdivision step divided by number of points before, often a?
		stationary schemes: subdivision rule is independent of location in polygon and independent of point position ? 
		even points: old points that existed before a subdivision step and are still exisiting afterwards
		odd points: points inserted by a subdivision step ? 
		linear: rule is affine combination of even points ?

	&q what is? how is used? the idea? adv. and disadv.? 
		> Sufficient Continuity Condition
		> a mask is called contractive,
		if the absolute values of even and odd elements, i.e. of the stencils, sum to less than 1. 
		The limit curve is Ck -continuous
		if the k?1-th difference scheme multiplied by 2 k is contractive
		i.e. m(z) can be divided by (z?1) k?1 and 2 k �? k?1m(z) is contractive.
