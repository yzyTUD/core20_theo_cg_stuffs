	Parallax Occlusion Mapping

	Self-intersections may occur.

		The entire scene is dynamically compiled into a GLSL shader.
		To calculate a pixel color, a ray is shot into the scene and allowed to bounce around five times
		LOCAL ILLUMINATION
		Common simplifications
		ignore indirect lighting
		restrict light source types
		avoid solving integrals in the rendering equation,
		restrict mirror reflection to planar surfaces
		calculate hard shadows or approximate soft shadows in another rendering pass
		use efficient-to-evaluate materials
		Spot Light
		Local Illumination Models
		diffuse lighting
		specular lighting
		opening angle used to compute ambient occlusion factor
		ambient lighting (once)
		Lambertian Radiation
		portional to cosine of ??

		outgoing radiance
		The sun is no Lambertian Radiator
		Oren-Nayar � surface is composed of diffuse microfacets with stochastically distributed orientiations
		Oren-Nayar
		Lambertian �simplest model that is computed from cosine of angle between surface normal and incoming light direction

		Diffuse Reflection

		Constant BRDF yields local lighting model that depends on direction to light source but not on observer
		Lighting Calculations
		Constant BRDF
		surface reflects the same in all directions
		Albedo is the amount of reflected light over the amount of incoming light in dependence of wavelength typically represented as sRGB value
		For Lambertian albedo describes the reflection properties completely
		describes the reflection properties
		Specular Reflection
		Phong � oldest empirical models adds shininess 
		Blinn-Phong � based on mirror reflecting microfacets
		Cook Torrance � incorporates self-shadowing into microfacet model (see CG3)
		Diffuse lighting type
		Influence of shininess
		Specular lighting type
		Phong Blinn-Phong Cook-Torrance

		SHADER
		Which Coordinate System To Use?
		Preserves angles
		Preserves distances
		light attenuation
		All quantities must be transformed into the coordinate system
		Different quantities are usually given in different coordinate systems:
		Normals must be transformed with the inverse transpose of the transformation matrix.
		Too steep attenuation
		Eye Coord
		Fragment shader: Receive interpolated quantities.
		Use uniforms to calculate missing quantities.

		Calculate lighting
		Interpolated normal has non-unit length.
		39
		do the transformation at the end of every fragment shader
		use sRGB framebuffers with glEnable(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB);
		sRGB
		Pay attention to your input colors. Some of them might already be gamma-corrected (e.g. textures ? transform with ??h???????????? = ?????????????????? ?
		If you have multiple render passes, gamma correction is only needed in the last one.
		Object Coordinates
		World Coordinates
		Eye Coordinates
		Which Coordinate System To Use?
		How can shader codes be designed where different algorithms for different parts can be combined?
		Write modules for different algorithms and link them in the final program to a composed shader
		Attach Shader to Program
		can be choosen flexible with gui 
		hader function are used 
		one shader object is needed that contains the main function and declares operations
		Conceptionally
		�and other variables/instructions� here
		allows to reuse compiled codes and dynamically create shader programs that suit the current needs
		Realtime CG approximates realistic lighting
		Lighting calculations should be done in an anglepreserving coordinate system
		anglepreserving coordinate system.

		Work for lighting calculation is shared among CPU, vertex shader, and fragment shader.
		Work for lighting calculation
		Local illumination models are composed of ambient, diffuse (Lambertian / Oren-Nayar), and specular (Phong, Blinn-Phong, Cook-Torrance) components.
		Local illumination models
		Texturing
		adding details from a 2D image to a mesh.
		Every surface point addresses a point in the texture
		Every surface point
		Texture coordinates are defined as vertex attributes
		interpolated into triangles
		in DirectX
		The ??-axis in DirectX points in the opposite direction
		Solution: Flip image or texture coordinates.
