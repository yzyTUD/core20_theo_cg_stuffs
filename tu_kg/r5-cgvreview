q:what you did in the KPCG? 

a:
i deve. TD game for Machine Learning.
In the game, we *encouraged users to seg. a map dataset in 
a playful way. which may be boring before.

{
    //begin 
    as for detail, when the game begins, 
    a map is shown to the player. And the enemies wont 
    come imm. . 

    //game logic 
    so as a player we can prepare for that. 
    plant trees, forest.
    build maot, a river around the city. 
    construct buildings. 
    to earn money, can be used to build tower. 

    //ml back
    in this way to encourage players to segm. 
    eg. when we want to plant trees around a perticular area,
    we would have to draw a circle,it should along the road.
    players have to do so beacause the game was designed to prevent 
    people from draw sth. randomly by punishing them when 
    the circle he drawed is too rediculous, strange. 
    and it is also reaonable. Beacause it saves mony when we 
    build fence aroud it. 

    moren d, ml was used, was enhanced. some key-tech 
    {
        gen. pre-segmentation 
        waypoints 
        parameter adjestment 
    }

}

it was a TD game which can be used to collect user input as 
ground truth information in a database.

ready for further processing or tasks 

Semantic segmentation of topographic maps

in a playful way

encourage users to draw on the map to eg. plant trees 

planting spring wheat

spec. area of the map mark as a desired region 

earn money in this way 

enemies comes along a set of flexible waypoints
