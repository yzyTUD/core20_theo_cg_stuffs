        *The SELECT clause lists variables that you want returned
        *the WHERE clause contains restrictions on them
        All information in Wikidata (and similar knowledge databases) is stored in the form of triples
        fill in the variables with actual values so that the resulting triples appear in the knowledge databas
        returns one result for each combination of variables it finds.
        A triple can be read like a sentence (which is why it ends with a period)
        On Wikidata, items and properties are not identified by human-readable names like “father” (property) or “Bach” (item).
        To find the identifier for an item, we search for the item and copy the Q-number of the result that sounds like it’s 
            the item we’re looking for (based on the description, for example)
        but search for “P:search term” instead of just “search term”

        https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Search
        items should be prefixed with wd:, and properties with wdt
        somewhere within the WHERE clause, you get additional variables: For every variable ?foo in your query, you now also have a variable ?fooLabel
        magic text to add label for results 
            SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE]". }
            not covered in slids, but important for practice 
        *in where clause, 默认的关系是and
        , it’s possible to express the same abbreviation in SPARQL as well, similar to ttl case 
        use  semicolon (;) instead of a period
        you can add another predicate-object pair
        a , allows you to append another object to a triple (reusing both subject and predicate).
        indentation and other whitespaces don’t actually matter – they just make it more readable
        WDQS editor indents lines for you automatically
        a grandchild may be related to Bach via the mother or the father. That’s two different properties, which is inconvenient
        flip the relation around: Wikidata also has a “child” property
        names used in var to be selected will appear in table title 
        using group by:The second condition is that the rest of the variables in the SELECT should each result into one value.
