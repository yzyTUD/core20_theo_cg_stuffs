        Tactile Internet with Human-in-the-Loop
        How will we learn in the future?
        How will robots help the old and the oldest-old?
        democratising skills on global scale
        enable humans to interact in quasi real-time with cyber-physical systems (CPS)
        in the real or virtual world over intelligent wide-area communication networks
        intelligent communication networks and adaptive CPS
        online mutual learning mechanisms
        To tackle these challenges
        conduct unique interdisciplinary research
