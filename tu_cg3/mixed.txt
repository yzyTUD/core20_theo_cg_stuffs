                    基本没有计算流体的基础，在老板的催促下，从零基础到改代码也只用了2个月，我来从一个本科生的低端视角谈谈入门计算流体。
                    你得搞清楚conservative form的NS equation，因为我们本科学的那种用物质导数写的动量守恒是不好解的。
                    你会发现其实解NS方程跟wave equation也没啥大的差别。只不过，Ns里面的conserved variable是个vector.
                    通过Riemann solver求解interface flux，再通过flux correction得到continuous flux。这几个步骤用到的数学知识也就是简单的插值
                    看Toro那本书也就能懂黎曼求解器了
                    一些流体力学、传热学的基础知识，几个基本方程要知道，几类边界条件得明白
                    然后学习一下简单的数值计算，例如如何用数值方法近似计算微分、如何用矩阵的形势表示方程组等
                    如果是打算自己编程算的话，那么就在高性能数值计算这个方向上深挖，主要就是如何进行大尺度矩阵运算
                    大尺度矩阵运算

                smoke simulation paper 
                    exploits physics unique to smoke in order to design a  numerical method
                    relatively  coarse grids
                    as compared to the much finer grids used in the computational  fluid dynamics literature
                    We use the inviscid Euler equations in  our model
                    since they are usually more appropriate for gas modeling and less computationally intensive than the viscous NavierStokes equations used by others.
                    Our model also correctly handles the interaction of 
                        smoke with moving objects.
                    interaction 
                    smoke is highly complex and  turbulent.
                    Visual smoke models have many obvious applications in

                    Only recently have researchers  in computer graphics 
                        started to excavate the abundant CFD literature 
                    Unfortunately, current CG smoke models are  either 
                        too slow or suffer from too much numerical dissipation.

                            Another approach using Monte Carlo methods has led to many different algorithms including path tracing, 
                                photon mapping, and Metropolis light transport, among others.

                    Rotation matrices are square matrices, with real entries
                    that is, a square matrix R is a rotation matrix if and only 
                        if RT = R-1 and det R = 1
                    Rotation matrices can either pre-multiply column 
                        vectors (Rv), or post-multiply row vectors (wR). H
                    However, Rv produces a rotation in the opposite direction with respect to wR. T
                    rotations produced on column vectors are described by means of a 
                    pre-multiplication
                    column vectors
                    To obtain exactly the same rotation (i.e. the same final coordinates of point P), the row vector must be post-multiplied by the transpose of R (i.e. wRT).
                    The rotation matrix of the orientation will be multiplied from the left and transposed from the right
                    he dot product of two column vectors is the matrix product
                    is the row vector obtained by transposing {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
                        \mathbf {x}  and the resulting 1? matrix is identified with

                        Penalty Methods vs. Analytical Methods
                        several advantages over penalty  methods. 
                        Penalty methods for rigid bodies are often computationally expensive
                        the differential equations  that arise using penalty methods may be "stiff"
                        In contrast, analytical methods for rigid bodies give exact  answers and produce differential equations
                        require far fewer  time steps during simulation
                        analytical solutions are based directly on the laws of Newtonian  dynamics.
                        Analytical methods however are much more complex  to derive and implement

                    变化率或通量之间的关系
                    用数学术语来讲，这些变化率对应于变量的导数
                    实用上，也只有最简单的情况才能用这种方法获得已知解。这些情况通常涉及稳定态（流场不随时间变化）的非紊流，

                    目前有多种商业CFD软件问世，比如FLUENT、CFD-ACE+（CFDRC）、Phoenics、CFX、Star-cd等。
                        CFD最基本的考虑是如何把连续流体在计算机上用离散的方式处理。一个方法是把空间区域离散化成小胞腔

                    大涡流模拟（LES）是一种技术，其中更小的涡流被滤掉并用亚格点尺度模型来建模，而更大的能量的涡流则被模拟出来。该方法通常比RANS模型需要更细化的网格，但是比DNS解所需要的网格粗的多。
                    离散化完成后要进行的方程系统的基本求解由很多数值线性代数的为人熟知的许多算法完成。可以使用静态的迭代方法，譬如对称高斯-赛得尔（Gauss-Seidel）或者渐进松弛（successive overrelaxation），或者克雷洛夫子空间法（Krylov subspaces）。在后者中，解的余数在非线性算子的一个子空间的正交基上最小化
                    这些技术广泛用于工程设计或者分析和流体相互作用的设备，例如车辆，飞行器，泵，化学装置和通风系统等等。该技术也用于计算机图形学，因为动画家不能像控制固态人物那样简单的处理流体，因而必须使用CFD技术结合交互工具，达成动画影片或游戏中的流体模拟

                    A sound choice of which extrapolation method to apply relies on a prior knowledge of the process that created the existing data points.

                qq why Z-order_curve can provide more locality? suitable for pgu parallel??

                    &h ***Some GPUs store texture maps in Z-order to increase spatial locality of

                        现在游戏基本都没有应用光源追踪技术，光线都是由你能看到的亮光的物体自身发出的，
                            电脑也不会计算每个光源从哪里来，
                            到哪里去，更不会计算这些光源的相互叠加。
                            只是通过及时演算物体阴影和控制光线的强弱来“模拟”人眼看到的真实情况
                        海中没有椰子树倒影这一点就很不真实。实际上，在游戏中使用的光源越多
                            画面在越貌似华丽的同时，破绽也会越多，唯一的解决办法就是采用光源跟踪技术。
                        原因很简单，使用光线追踪技术的运算量异常庞大，这么多年来的历代显卡都无法胜任这项工作
                        现在的光源追踪技术也远非完美。计算出正确的反射和折射角度也不代表就能达到完全真实的视觉效果
                        游戏开发人员试着在《雷神之锤Ⅲ》中加入了光线追踪效果，悬浮的奖励道具在墙上的投影就是通过光学追踪计算出来的，使得光源的真实感大大提高
                        种基于光栅化的渲染系统，往往只支持局部照明(Local Illumination)
                        局部照明在渲染几何图形的一个像素时，光照计算只能取得该像素的信息，而不能访问其他几何图形的信息。

                            该图片出自《孤岛惊魂》，尽管看似水面显示出了远处山峰的倒影，却不能渲染植被、船骸等细节。
                            理论上，阴影(Shadow)、反射(Reflection)、折射(Refraction)均为全局照明(Global Illumination)效果，
                            实际应用中，栅格化渲染系统可以使用预处理(如阴影贴图(shadow mapping)、环境贴图(environment mapping))去模拟这些效果
                            Rasterization和ray tracing其实是相对的
                            把物体表面间对光的反射和折射成为间接光、间接反射、间接折射。光线在物体之间的传播方式是光线跟踪算法的基础。
                            只有很少部分可以进入人的眼睛，因此实际光线跟踪算法的跟踪方向与光传播的方向是相反的（反向光线跟踪）
                            由视点与像素(x,y)发出一根射线
                            光栅化渲染，简单地说，就是把大量三角形画到屏幕上。当中会采用深度缓冲(depth buffer, z-buffer)，来解决多个三角形重叠时的前后问题
                            光线追踪除了容易支持一些全局光照效果外，亦不局限于三角形作为几何图形的单位。任何几何图形，能与一束光线计算交点(intersection point)，就能支持
                            没有三角形化这个过程！ 
                            要计算一点是否在阴影之内，也只须发射一束光线到光源，检测中间是否存在障碍物。

                            下一层就会失去对上一层全局信息的了
                            比如拆分成物体后，我们就不知道场景里其他物体的存在了，拆分成三角面后，我们就无法得知其他三角面的信息
                            拆解任务可以让渲染过程高度并行化，所以非常的快，但是同时因为全局信息的丢失，我们很难实现一些需要全局信息的渲染效果。
                            全局照明效果的，譬如环境光遮蔽，间接反射，漫射等。这些技术五花八门，实现方法完全没有一个统一的框架可以遵循
                            这些光线彼此不知道对方，但却知道整个场景的信息。每条光线会和场景并行地求交，根据交点位置获取表面的材质、纹理等信息，并结合光源信息计算光照
                            一个三角面/一根光线的整个绘制过程都可以划分为若干个阶段，这些阶段合在一起就是我们通常意义上说的管线（Pipeline）
                            可编程管线则允许用户使用自定义的着色器（Shader）对数据（顶点，面，像素）进行处理
                            在原有光栅化管线的基础上，也就引申出了计算管线（Compute Pipeline）
                            DXR API实际上就是定义了一种适用于光线追踪的Raytrace Pipeline。

                        BRDF描述的是表面本身的性质，比如它的光滑程度，导电程度等等
                        一部分是表面的自发光（上述公式中的 [公式] ）

                        BRDF描述的是表面本身的性质，比如它的光滑程度，导电程度等等。由于四面八方的光线都会作用在这个表面，所以我们需要对所有方向进行积分，也就是一个球面上的积分
                        只有位于正半空间的方向才会对最终积分有贡献，所以最后这个球面的积分就变成了一个半球的积分

                    蒙特卡洛积分
                        本身只是一种数值计算的方法，它和光线追踪本身无关
                        蒙特卡洛积分就是这样一种方法。它的思路很简单：为了估计某个函数在一个定义域内的积分，我只需要在这个定义域内随机地找一些采样点，
                            计算采样点所在位置的函数值，把所有采样点的函数值平均即可得到该积分的估计值：
                            对一些高维的难以求解的积分有非常好的效果，而渲染方程就是这样的一类积分，所以它常常被用在求解渲染方程上
                        如果我们先验地知道函数的形状，那我们就可以针对性地生成非均匀分布的随机样本，这样能够在相同样本数量的情况下对目标积分得到一个更准确的估计
                    重要性采样
                        和它的名字一样，就是尽量采样积分定义域内重要的点，少采样不重要的点。
                    路径追踪
                        渲染方程本身在绝大多数情况下是无法直接求解的
                        人们把渲染方程用不同的数学等价形式改写，然后对新的方程形式进行近似求解
                        以它的法线为中心向半球内发射若干条光线，求出每条光线和场景的交点，要进一步以交点的法线为中心发射若干条光线
                        极难求解的递归过程
                        而路径追踪的方法把某个点的颜色看作是若干条光路（Path）合起来的贡献。一条光路可以认为是若干表面点连接而成的一条线段，为了计算某个点的着色，
                            我们只需要以该点为起点，构建若干条路径，并将每条路径上的光照贡献叠加即可。
                            我们可以认为路径追踪就是把光线以路径的形式重新组织了起来

                        https://www.cnblogs.com/machong8183/p/7543724.html
                        (Global Illumination,简称 GI), 或被称为Indirect Illumination
                        既考虑场景中直接来自光源的光照（Direct Light）又考虑经过场景中其他物体反射后的光照（Indirect Light）的一种渲染技术。
                        使用全局光照能够有效地增强场景的真实感。
                        在直接光源（阳光）照射不到的地方，得到了更好的亮度和细节表现，从而使整张渲染效果更具真实感。
                        *仅仅使用直接光照的渲染中往往有黑色不真实阴影，因为光源没法直接照射到--区分
                        *镜面反射、折射、阴影一般不需要进行复杂的光照方程求解，也不需要进行
                            迭代的计算。因此，这些部分的算法已经十分高效，甚至可以做到实时
                        光的漫反射表面反弹时的方向是近似“随机”，因此不能用简单的光线跟踪得到反射的结果，
                            ***往往需要利用多种方法进行多次迭代，直到光能分布达到一个基本平衡的状态
                        全局光照现今已有多种实现方向
                        以及各种实现派别
                            如光线追踪（Ray Tracing）派系，其实就是一个框架，符合条件的都可称为光线追踪，
                                其又分为递归 式光线追踪（Whitted-style Ray Tracing），
                                分布式光线追踪（Distribution Ray Tracing），
                                蒙特卡洛光线追踪（Monte Carlo Ray Tracing）等。
                            而路径追踪（Path tracing）派系，又分为蒙特卡洛路径追踪
                                （Monte Carlo Path Tracing），
                                双向路径追踪（BidirectionalPath Tracing），
                                能量再分配路径追踪（Energy Redistribution Path Tracing）等。
                            其中有些派系又相互关联，如路径追踪，就是基于光线追踪，
                                结合了蒙特卡洛方法而成的一种新的派系
                        编年
                            ray casting 
                                从每一个像素射出一条射线，然后找到最接近的物体挡住射线的路径
                            光线追踪 Ray Tracing [1979]
                                如果该点处表面是镜面或折射面，则继续向反射或折射方向跟踪另一条光线，如此递归下去，直到光线逃逸出场景或达到设定的最大递归深度。
                            **渲染方程 The Rendering Equation [1986]
                                场景中光能传输达到稳定状态以后，物体表面某个点在某个方向上的辐射率（Radiance）与入射辐射亮度等的关系。
                                可以将渲染方程理解为全局光照算法的基础，Kajiya在1986年第一次将渲染方程引入图形学后，随后出现的很多全局光照的算法，都是以渲染方程为基础，对其进行简化的求解，以达到优化性能的目的
                                渲染方程根据光的物理学原理，以及能量守恒定律，完美地描述了光能在场景中的传播。很多真实感渲染技术都是对它的一个近似
                                是物理上对于光线的一个完美描述
                            Path Tracing [1986]
                                根据渲染方程， Kajiya 提出的路径追踪方法是第一个无偏（Unbiased）的渲染方法
                            双向路径追踪（Bidirectional Path Tracing）的基本思想是同时从视点、光源打出射线，经过若干次反弹后，
                                将视点子路径（ eye path） 和光源子路径（ light path） 上的顶点连接起来（连接时需要测试可见性），
                                以快速产生很多路径
                            梅特波利斯光照传输 Metropolis Light Transport [1997]
                                怎样去尽可能多的采样一些贡献大的路径，而该方法可以自适应的生成贡献大的路径，简单来说它会避开贡献小的路径
                        传统的光线跟踪并不一定是真实效果图像，只有在非常近似或者完全实现渲染方程的时候才能实现真正的真实效果图像
                        环境光遮蔽（Ambient Occlusion，简称AO）是全局光照明的一种近似替代品
                        可以产生重要的视觉明暗效果，通过描绘物体之间由于遮挡而产生的阴影， 能够更好地捕捉到场景中的细节
                        可以解决漏光，阴影漂浮等问题，改善场景中角落、锯齿、裂缝等细小物体阴影不清
                        AO 特效在直观上给玩家的主要感觉体现在画面的明暗程度上

                            can be derived by constructing interpolating functions that are easy to integrate
                            Typically these interpolating functions are polynomials.
                            only polynomials of low degree are used, typically linear and quadratic.

                        Phong reflection is an [empirical model] of [local illumination]
                        It describes the way a surface reflects light
                        It is based on Phong's informal observation 
                        The model also includes an ambient term to account for the small amount of light that is scattered 
                        for physical plausible issue, we can further modify the phong model! 
                            *by adding the diffuse cosine to the specular part

                        it has Computationally more efficient alterations

                            both blue, and the specular color is white

                        比如有1%的微表面朝向是[公式]，那么就有1%的微表面可能将光线反射到[公式]方向

                        Masking
                        光线在微表面之间还会互相反射，如下面右边的图，这可能也是一部分漫射光的来源，在建模高光时忽略掉这部分光线
                        光学平面并不会将所有光线都反射掉，而是一部分被反射，一部分被折射，反射比例符合菲涅尔方程（Fresnel Equations）

                    where each  technique is designed to sample some feature of the 
                        integrand that might otherwise lead to high variance

                Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the 
                    irradiance (flux per unit area) received by a surface
                The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the

                    of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface
                Directional-hemispherical reflectance is the reflectance of a surface under direct illumination (with no diffuse component)

                    is a reflectivity model for diffuse reflection from rough surfaces. 
                    It has been shown to accurately predict the appearance 
                        of a wide range of natural surfaces, such as concrete, plaster, sand
                    Reflectance is a physical property of a material that describes 
                        how it reflects incident light. 
                    reflectance properties
                    *Most reflectance models can be broadly classified into two categories: 
                        diffuse and specular
                    the diffuse component is often assumed to be Lambertian. 
                    *A surface that obeys Lambert's Law appears equally 
                        bright from all viewing directions.
                    This model for diffuse reflection was proposed by 
                        Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1760 
                    has been perhaps the most widely used reflectance model 
                        in computer vision and graphics
                    however, the Lambertian model is an inadequate 
                        approximation of the diffuse component.
                    qq why Lambertian model inadequate ?
                        This is primarily because the Lambertian model 
                            *does not take the roughness of the surface into account.
                    Rough surfaces can be modelled as a set of facets 
                        with different slopes
                    Analysis of this phenomenon has a long history and can be traced back almost a century
                    fit experimental data 
                    The Oren朜ayar reflectance model, developed by Michael Oren and Shree K. Nayar in 1993
                    The model takes into account complex physical phenomena such as masking, shadowing and interreflections between points on the surface facets. I
                    It can be viewed as a generalization of Lambert抯 law
                    important implications for human vision and computer vision problems, such as shape from shading, photometric stereo, etc.

                    be composed of long symmetric V-cavities.
                    Each cavity consists of two planar facets
                    In particular, the Gaussian distribution is often used, 
                        and thus the variance of the Gaussian distribution
                    the variance of the Gaussian distribution, 
                        {\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}\sigma ^{2}, is a measure of the 
                        roughness of the surfaces.
                    The standard deviation of the facet slopes 
                        (gradient of the surface elevation)
                    *In the Oren-Nayar reflectance model, 
                        each facet is assumed to be Lambertian in reflectance
                    In the case of {\displaystyle \sigma =0}\sigma =0 
                        (i.e., all facets in the same plane), 
                        we have {\displaystyle A=1}A=1, 
                        and {\displaystyle B=0}B=0, and thus 
                        the Oren-Nayar model simplifies to the Lambertian model:

                    the BRDF is a function of four dimensions
                    there are problems with light source and camera stability
                    Ward built an imaging reflectometer that uses the 
                        two degrees of freedom inherent in a camera 
                        imaging system to reduce the number of moving parts
                    the system captures the light reflected into all directions at once
                    Since Ward fit his data to a model with a small number of free parameters, 
                        these were not major problems. They confirm, however, 
                        how difficult it is to measure BRDFs, even with careful attention to the measuring apparatus.

                    BRDF是关于入射光方向和反射光方向的四维实值函数，
                        它等于反射方向的光亮度和沿入射方向的入射光的辉度之比：
                    BRDF的可逆性源自于Helmholtz光路可逆性
                    交换入射光和反射光的角色，并不会改变BRDF的值
                    能量守恒性质
                    可以写成不同角度入射光的光亮度乘BRDF的积分
                    Phong模型缺乏物理解释
                        并且对于某些金属材质，它并不十分准确
                    Phong模型是在Lambert漫反射模型的基础上，添加了镜面反射项，以表达反射角上的镜面反射效果

                    In practice this function is obtained as a set of several thousand color images of material sample
                    It is an image-based representation, since the geometry of the surface is unknown and not measured.

                    次表面散射是现实中一种非常常见的材质外观，所有有着半透明外观的物体
                    例如玉石，大理石，蜡烛，可乐，苹果，牛奶（见下图）包括人类的皮肤，等等。
                    半透明
                    下图则是电影《功夫熊猫3》中的一幕，画面中的玉石也是次表面散射材质的典型例子之一。
                    次表面散射现象的模拟也比在前三篇文章里介绍过的一般的表面反射复杂很多，因为要正确的模拟这种现象，光线不止再物体的表面发生散射，而是会先折射到物体内部
                    对于次表面散射性质的材质来说，光线出射的位置和入射的位置是不一样的，而且每一点的亮度取决于物体表面所有其他位置的亮度
                    物体的形状，厚度等
                    BSDF只能用于描述物体表面某一点的散射性质
                    所以它无法描述像次表面散射这种现象。
                    要模拟这样的现象，最简单，最精确，也是计算量最大，最慢的方法，就是直接在物体内部的空间求解带有Participating Media的渲染方程
                    例如最简单的Volumetric Path Tracing，Volumetric Photon Mapping等等。
                    [2]是最简单的Volumetric Path Tracing的tutorial，[3]是State of the art的Participating media estimator。因为话题很大，这里不再展开，以后有时间会再专门写写相关的内容。
                    BSSRDF可以指定不同的光线入射位置和出射的位置。Jensen在2001年的论文[4]可以说那是次表面材质建模最重要的一篇论文，推导了许多重要的物理公式
                    BSSRDF重要性采样
                    计算模型，渲染时的参数转换，以及测量了许多生活中常见材质的散射系数等等
                    大部分后来的论文都是在基于这篇文章中的理论的一些提升。不过这篇论文中有大量的数学以及物理公式
                    https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/bssrdf/bssrdf.pdf
                    BSSRDF的意义在于快速的近似。对于许多吸收系数特别低，散射系数特别高的材质来说（大部分浑浊的半透明物体例如牛奶，大理石，苹果，肉等等）

                    当然实际渲染中这种平面不存在，所有模型都不是无限厚度的，也都是有各种形状的，
                        现实中所有物体内部的散射系数也都肯定不会是均匀的
                    这也是BSSRDF近似渲染的最主要的错误来源。
                    EDXRay里用两种完全不同的方法渲染的颜色
                    材质以及介质参数完全一样的两个佛像。左边的佛像是基于BSSRDF，右边的则是无偏的Participating Media
                    BSSRDF因为假设所有表面都的厚度都是无限的，在实际模型中如果有厚度比较薄的地方，误差会更为明显。
                    这也是为什么BSSRDF渲染的结果相比Participating Media要暗淡一些。除了这些误差以外，BSSRDF也没办法渲染出焦散

                    path integral formulation
                    integral equation approach requires  two equations (the light transport and measurement equations)
                    defined recursively
                    Measurements are defined and computed directly, by organizing the calculations around a  geometric primitive (the path)
                    Each path specifies the emission,  scattering, and measurement events along a complete photon trajectory
                    along a complete photon trajectory
                    starting with a vertex in the middle,  and building the path outwards in both directions
                    With the path integral approach, on the other hand,  it is possible to construct paths in arbitrary ways

                    For example, this is  what happens when the BSDF at an existing vertex is sampled
                    once  a vertex on a light source has been chosen
                    combining these three simple techniques, it is possible to sample paths in a great variety  of ways
                    general enough to accommodate  virtually all path sampling techniques that are used in practice
                    compare the probabilities with which a given path is sampled by different techniques.
                    Heckbert抯 regular expression notation for paths
                    Heckbert [1990] introduced a useful notation 
                    classifying paths by means of regular expressions.
                    L denotes the first vertex of the path
                    E denotes the last vertex (the camera position or 揺ye?

                    Multiple Importance Sampling
                    using more  than one sampling technique to evaluate a given integral
                    Our motivation is that most numerical integration problems in computer graphics are  揹ifficult?
                    we would like to design a sampling strategy that gives a low-variance  estimate of the integral.
                    We do not construct new  sampling techniques ?we assume that these are given to us
                    by computing weighted combinations of the sample values
                    can be parameterized by a set of weighting functions
                    Our goal is to find an estimator with minimum  variance, by choosing these weighting functions appropriately
                    we can take several potentially good techniques and combine  them so that the strengths of each are preserved.
                    This chapter is organized as follows.
                    variance reduction techniques
                    multi-pass algorithms
                    The glossy highlights problem
                    Smooth surfaces (r = 0)  correspond to highly polished, mirror-like reflections
                    while rough surfaces (r = 1) correspond to diffuse reflection
                    It is possible to simulate a variety of surface finishes by using  intermediate roughness values in the range 0 < r < 1.
                    different light source sizes and surface finishes
                    then examine why each one has high variance in some situations.
                    sampling the BSDF and sampling the light source
                    samples  were chosen according to the density
                    subtended by the light source at the current poin
                    One of these sampling strategies can have a much lower variance than the other, depending  on the size of the light source and the surface roughness paramete
                    For example, if the light  source is small and the material is relatively diffuse, then sampling the light source gives  far better results than sampling the BSD

                    n sampling the BSDF is far superio
                    high variance is caused by inadequate sampling where the integrand  is larg
                    e ideal density function for sampling would be proportional to the product of  all of these factor
                    neither sampling strategy takes all of these factors into accoun

                    y, so that we can express the two sampling strategies as different  probability distributions on the same domai
                    many problems in graphics that are similar to the glossy highlights exampl
                    large number of integrals of a specific form must be evaluate
                    depend on  various parameters of the scene mode
                    This makes it difficult to design an adequate sampling strategy, since  the parameter values are not known in advance. 
                    The main issue is that we would like low-variance results for the entire range of parameter value
                    too complicated to sample from directl
                    unconsidered factors has a large effec
                    Our main concern
                    how these samples can be automatically combined to obtain low-variance results over the entire range of surface roughness  and light source parameters.
                    Monte Carlo integration can be made more robust by using  more than one sampling technique to evaluate the same integral
                    can be represented as a set of weighting functions
                    balance heuristic
                    This image was rendered using both the BSDF sampling strategy and the light  source sampling strategy
                    The samples are exactly the same as those for Figure 9.2(a) and  (b), except that here the two kinds of samples are combined using the balance heuristic.
                    effective over the entire range of glossy surfaces
                    These images show close-ups of the glossy highlights test scene
                    it does not work quite as well as the other
                    We now present two families of combination strategies
                    maximum heuristic.
                    power heuristic
                    Variance bounds
                    The final gather problem
                    we consider a simple test case motivated by multi-pass light transport algorithms.
                    combination  strategies
                    Notice that the sampling technique in Figure 9.12(a) does not work well for points near  the light source, since this technique does not take into account the 1=r2  distance term of the  scattering equation
                    It extends importance sampling to the case where more than  one sampling technique is used
                    integrand is a  sum of several quantities
                    A good example in graphics is the BSDF, which is often written  as a sum of diffuse, glossy, and specular components 
                    The process of taking one or more samples from each component is essentially a form of  stratified sampling
                    the sample allocation is not as important as choosing a good  combination strateg
                    can improve the variance by at most a factor  of n, plus a small additive ter
                    the optimal sample allocation is irrelevant
                    sophisticated sampling  strategies are generally designed for a specific light source geometry
                    y (e.g. the light source  must be a triangle or a sphere)
                    Second, they are often expensive: for example, taking a sample may involve numerical inversion of a function
                    Thus, combining  samples from two or more techniques
                    make direct lighting calculations more robust
                    additional  cost is small
                    have shown strong bounds on their performance relative to all other combination strategies
                    the balance heuristic is an excellent choice for a combination strategy: it has the best theoretical bounds
                    and is the simplest to implement.

                    better performance is most noticeable
                    Direct  lighting calculations are a good example of where this optimization is useful
                    useful
                    provides a new viewpoint on Monte Carlo integration
                    o find a single “perfect”  sampling technique, here the goal is to find a set of techniques that cover the important features of the integrand
                    It does not matter if there are a few bad sampling techniques as well
                    the results will not be significantly affected.
                    whenever there is some situation that is not handled well, then we can simply add another sampling technique designed for that situation alone
                    We believe that there  are many applications that could benefit from this approach, both in computer graphics and  elsewhere.
                    By varying the number of vertices generated from each side, we obtain a family of sampling techniques for paths of all  lengths
                    Samples from all of these techniques are then combined  using multiple importance sampling

                    each measurement can  be written in the form

                    sampling different kinds of effects
                    (b) works well under most circumstances (for paths of length two), technique (a)  can be superior if the table is very glossy or specular
                    Similarly, techniques (c) or (d) can  have the lowest variance if the light source is highly directional.
                    correspond to different density  functions ps;t on the space of paths
                    All of these density functions are good candidates for  importance sampling
                    because they take into account different factors of the measurement  contribution function fj
                    a wide variety of scenes and lighting  effects can be handled well.

                    *sampling the secondary paths with help of [Markov Chain Monte Carlo]

                    some interesting applications exits:
                        We could also use MLT to render a sequences of images (as
                            in animation), by sampling the the entire space-time of paths

                        with a door slightly ajar between them
                        The problem is that for some environments, most
                            paths do not contribute significantly to the image
                        Naive path tracing will be very inefficient, 
                            because it will have difficulty generating paths

                    马尔可夫蒙特卡洛方法（MCMC，Markov Chain Monte Carlo）算法被引入到渲染领域
                        这个被称为影响20世纪科技发展最重要的
                        与传统的蒙特卡洛方法（例如路径追踪）不同的是
                        它通过利用样本之间的相关性来更好地探索一个分布函数
                    相关性
                    使得一些非常困难的路径可以更轻易被采样到，然而MLT算法依赖于非常好的突变策略
                    2002年，Csaba Kelemen提出了PSSMLT算法
                        （Simple and Robust Mutation Strategy for Metropolis Light Transport Algorithm）
                    这个采样的过程实际上是对多个[0,1]的随机数的采样过程，
                        这些[0,1]随机数构成一个高维的单位超立方体（unit-hypercube），
                        这称为原采样空间（Primary sample space
                        所以如果直接对该空间采样，也能够得到一条路径。
                    另外最重要的是因为使用重要性采样，原采样空间的被积函数为f/p接近为一个常数，
                        这使得原采样空间的被积函数更平坦，采样的方差更低，
                        考虑传统的MLT算法并没有使用重要性采样
                    Markov Chain Monte Carlo
                    qq idea of PSSMLT
                    高维的单位超立方体（unit-hypercube）
                    它将“路径采样”当做一个黑盒子：它直观给你一些随机数，不管你使用什么方法给我一条路径就可以
                    某个顶点一个微小的突变可能导致后续路径发生较大的变换，从而使种子路径和突变路径差异太大而丧失相关性
                    MLT算法被提出来后最重大的一个进展要数2014年Toshiya Hachisuka提出的
                        MMLT算法（Multiplexed Metropolis Light Transport）
                    路径除了在每个原采样空间内部执行突变，还可以在不同采样技术之间执行突变。
                    这是一种采样技术，叫Metropolis Sampling。
                    Metropolis Sampling只需要你能求得f(x)的值，就可以自动生成一组和f
                        的大小成比例的样本（就是下图中的红点，f越大红点越密集）
                    这些所有路径中只有一部分路径对最终成像有比较大的贡献的
                        （一个光线照不到的桌子底下反射100次也是没有什么贡献的）
                    不在没有贡献的路径上面浪费计算量
                    绝大多数路径都没有贡献因为他们被强挡住了，所有求交和brdf采样求值的计算都浪费了。
                    如果用markov chain来生成样本，则得到的路径是这样的。
                        大多数路径都是刚好能有效连接光源和camera的。
                    Metropolis Sampling主要就是用来渲染一些采样路径特别复杂的场景的
                    一般室外大太阳的场景用不着付出额外的计算去用这么fancy的采样方法
                    Metropolis Light Transport的论文就是用了一个光源在一个
                        微微打开的门缝后面的场景当的例子
                    Metroplis Sampling也可以比较高效的计算Specular-Diffuse-Specular这种路径
                    Specular-Diffuse-Specular
                    high level的说了一下为什么渲染可以用到markov chain。
                        具体的实现也不麻烦，基于一个叫Detailed Balance的方法
                    首先光线传递的随机性（光子抵达物体表面材质后被吸收或随机反射）仅由当前状态决定，
                        和历史无关，满足马可夫过程定义
                    满足马可夫过程定义
                    第二，现实场景的物体材质不存在全部是完美镜面的情况，也就是系统中存在扩散/耗散项（非Dirac分布的BRDF，以及吸收项），所以能量分布会趋于稳定，收敛到一个稳态
                    光线传播本身是time-dependent模型，但是渲染里假定了能量瞬间完成重分布，
                        所以需要证明稳态方程解的存在唯一性。
                    MMLT的重要意义在于它将统计中的模拟回火（simulated tempering）
                        的思路引入到了MLT算法中
                    模拟退火本来用于解决最优质问题，由于物体加温之后分子状态之间的转移更活跃，
                        因此状态更易于在全局转移
                    而随着温度逐渐降低，状态之间的转移就逐渐减弱。所以为了求最优值
                    所以为了求最优值，如下图中的最大值，我们首先将温度升高，
                        然后让其慢慢冷却，在其过程中不断寻找最大值，
                        随着温度降低，最终将停留在最大值处。
                    在MMLT算法中，温度即是采样技术，不同的采样技术将原采样空间划分为多个子空间。
                    当采样技术发生改变时，虽然所有的[0,1]随机数并没有发生变化，
                        但是由于使用了不同的采样技术，这些随机数被使用的方式也完全不同了
                    理想情况下，我们希望在改变采样技术时，能够保持路径不变。
                        因此， Benedikt Bitterli于今年提出的RJMCMC
                        （Reversible Jump Metropolis Light Transport using Inverse Mappings）
                    使用一个反向映射方法，当从采样技术1向采样技术2转移时，
                        它将状态1对应的原采样空间的路径在对应路径空间中的形式，
                        通过一个反向映射转换到采样技术2对应的原采样空间，
                        这个过程是决定性（deterministic）计算的
                    Jacopo Pantaleon的CMLT（Charted Metropolis Light Transport）
                        几乎也与上述思路类似，但是强调更泛化的概念

                        Markov Chain Monte Carlo Rendering在算法上稍微不同于上述两篇论文

                    不像PBRT聚焦于比较经典的路径追踪算法实现，《全局光照技术》覆盖了截止2017年大量的行业中最前沿的渲染技术
                    例如VCM/UPS，降噪技术，频率域分析，微分流形/几何，梯度域渲染，基于光束的参与媒介渲染技术等等
                    这些都是近几年离线渲染领域最前沿的方向和技术，被广泛运用于最近皮克斯，迪士尼等动画电影当中，使读者能够了解到最前沿的行业动态和趋势
                    而 《Physically Based Rendering: From the Theory to Implementation》聚焦于离线渲染
                    实时和离线渲染同属于计算机图形学领域， 它们只是在当前硬件水平下针对实时性需求的划分
                    很多实时的全局光照模型都是从离线渲染模型优化，改进而来
                    全局光照技术》主要是按照各种全局光照技术为主线进行组织的，本书基本上覆盖了当前行业中最重要的约十种全局光照技术，例如针对离线渲染领域的路径追踪，梅特波利斯光照传输，光子映射，针对交互式需求的辐射度方法
                    为了加速光线追踪计算，与Path tracing直接从物体复杂的几何表述中获取光照信息不同，Photon mapping方法则将光照信息存储为一个独立的数据结构(称为 Photon map)
                    这大大加速了光线追踪的计算。
                    形成了一本270多页的英文稿子（如下视频），虽然该稿子仅仅是出于学习的目的，因此内容不是很严谨，但是它依然能够帮助我建立起一个3D渲染技术的宏观视图，它可以说是现在这本《全局光照技术》的重要基础，并且我相信很少有人在学习的过程中能够形成这种级别的笔记稿子。
                    在这个学习的过程中，我感觉到了知识系统性的重要性，尤其对于图形学这种涉及大量数学知识，以及各种各样算法实现的学科，因此我尝试去总结各种知识的分类及其之间的联系
                    于是我在完成第一章之后就将其大约80多页的内容放到网络上供大家下载试读，我希望借助这种方式能够实时收集到读者的反馈和建议
                    然后印刷上市后才能收到读者的反馈，然而这些反馈基本上对图书质量没有用处，因为它必须要等到再版时才能根据这些反馈作出调整，而很多技术图书甚至没有再版的机会。

                    这种光子模拟过程为渲染增加了真实感，帮助数字艺术家得到更为生动、真实的画面。
                    GI也可以营造出极高质量的效果。
                    当光子碰撞到一个粗糙的表面，它就会被 随机地向各个方向散射出去，
                        这就是所谓的Diffuse Global Illumination(漫反射全局照明)

                    In Redshift, all of these techniques are called “GI Engines”
                    Each GI Engine has its pros and cons. 
                    为什么要有分别独立的Primary和Secondary的GI引擎呢？
                        Primary GI 的效果对于相机是直接可见的，
                        所以需要尽可能地提高渲染品质级别。另一方面，
                        Secondary GI照明往往对最终光影影响很小，
                        所以可以用稍低的质量（可以想像成“虚化”或者“噪点”）而不会影响最终渲染质量。
                    For reasonable numbers of photons, it renders fast
                    唯一可以渲染Caustic(焦散)效果的方式。

                    Photons have to be stored in GPU memory so 
                        too many photons can be prohibitive in terms of memory usage

                        他们花的时间以及存储它们都会是一种成的浪费

                    一开始出现的是Photon Mapping，后来有了Progressive Photon Mapping，
                        后来才有了Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping。
                    SPPM是PPM的改版（或者说“升级版”）。SPPM的优势是没有内存的限制。
                    能轻易捕捉到各种光照效果(比如Monte Carlo ray tracing不易捕捉到的SDS路径)
                    这主要表现为灰暗的墙角，错误的颜色辉映以及漏光等现象。
                    photon ray gathering，需要建立复杂的数据结构比如ray map。
                    紧接着，在07年由Herzog等人提出了photon ray splatting以代替photon ray gathering
                    该方法将整个光子映射算法流程倒了过来，即先进行eye tracing,再进行photon tracing。
                    这种由于密度估计范围r的不趋于零而存在的一种偏差，要解决这一问题，就必须想办法将光子数量扩大到无穷大
                    实际上，借用photon ray splatting中倒转光子映射算法流程的思想，可以破除光子映射中内存的限制，原因很简单，因为屏幕像素有限，所以要存下eye sample到内存是很轻松的事情
                    那么光子图根本就不需要存储，这样要多少光子就可以发射多少光子。
                    08年，由Hachisuka等人提出了渐进式光子映射(Progressive Photon Mapping)
                    通过第一步将eye sample组织成一个kd-tree结构，而后一轮轮地发射光子，每一轮将r减小一次，每一轮渲染一张图片。
                    由于倒转了PM算法的步骤顺序，PPM算法的光子搜集方法又从KNN变回到了直方图估计
                    但是由于PPM算法本身已经没有了光子数量的限制，所以这点劣势很容易以大量的光子数量扳回
                    有了PPM，我们甚至可以不需要final gathering，因为final gathering本身也极其耗时，且不能消除偏差
                    如果是像反走样这样简单的活还可以依靠在eye sample kd-tree中存下每个像素点的所有超采样点来完成的话，那么要模拟反射模糊，景深，运动模糊就更麻烦了
                    要模拟反射模糊，景深，运动模糊就更麻烦了
                    09年，还是Hachisuka，在PPM算法稍作改进，提出了SPPM(Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping)，该算法与PPM不同之处在于，在每一轮光子发射完毕后重新进行一次eye tracing
                    并且每次eye tracing都带上一个随机的扰动，让每次构建的eye sample kd-tree中的数据都不一样，下图展示了这两个算法的区别：
                    这样做使得SPPM效率上略低于PPM，但是换来的是更加健壮和灵活，实际上SPPM在处理gloss反射的时候效果远好于PPM
                    11年Claude Knaus等人就证明了这种方式和PPM算法具有同样的鲁棒性，由于和标准PM算法的极其相似，所以之前在标准PM算法中可用的扩展
                    正向跟踪和逆向跟踪两种思想
                    两个方向相互对称，而它们每个都具有另一个所没有的优点，bidirectional pathtracing连接了正向与逆向两个路径
                    photon mapping同样利用了正向与逆向两个方向的信息，不仅如此，它还重用了信息(光子图)，所以一般情况下能比bidirectional pathtracing收敛更快
                    从古老的正向跟踪算法Monte Carlo Light Tracing中，可以看到正向跟踪普遍存在的问题，当场景空间很大，但是能被视点看到的部分却很小的时候，会有大量的采样点对最终图像额颜色值贡献很小甚至毫无贡献
                    受到Metropolis light transport的启发，Fan Shaohua等人于05年将Metropolis准则引入了PM算法中的photon tracing中
                    11年，Chen jiating等人在SPPM基础上加入Metropolis准则，同样提高了SPPM在这类场景的收敛速率。

                        其核心思想是颠倒了光子发射和光线跟踪计算的顺序，逐步求精计算结果
                    Finally, our approach is readily applicable to volumetric photon mapping
                    We compare our algorithm to previous progressive  
                        photon mapping approaches and show that we 
                        achieve the same convergence to unbiased results, 
                        even without local photon statistics.
                    https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/publications/PPMProbabilistic-TOG11.pdf
                    We fixed the initial radius globally
                    using a box kernel (top row)  and a Gaussian kernel (bottom row).
                    numerically approximate solutions of the rendering equation [Kajiya 1986].
                    at equal computational cost, it can often produce images with less noise than other Monte Carlo algorithms
                    the expected  error of any approximation with a limited number of samples is  non-zero.
                    biased
                    The reason for the computational efficiency of photon mapping is  that it caches and reuses Monte Carlo samples.
                    This approximation, however, acts similarly to a low-pass  filter on the cached samples.
                    It always returns an overly smooth  approximation of the true radiance, and hence causes the non-zero  expected error, or bias, of the solution.
                    This bias only vanishes in  theory, if it were possible to cache an infinite number of photons.
                    a simple strategy that breaks this memory bottleneck. 
                    They incrementally update a sequence of photon mapping  results,
                    where each step in the sequence uses a limited number of  photons.
                    The key is to reduce the radius such that, in  the limit, the incremental updates converge to an exact, unbiased  solution of the rendering equation
                    The statistics include for example the  number of photons collected in the region
                    the regions are generalized to  render effects such as glossy reflections or depth of field.
                    we introduce a probabilistic derivation of progressive photon mapping
                    The key property of our approach is that it  does not require the maintenance of local statistics.
                    memoryless progressive photon mapping
                    As a benefit, we can  compute each step in parallel or with a standard photon mapper  used as a black box
                    a standard photon mapper  used as a black box
                    allows for arbitrary  kernels in the radiance estimate
                    we demonstrate that it is readily applicable to volumetric photon  mapping
                    we achieve the same convergence to unbiased results,  even without local statistics.
                    In summary, we make the following contributions:
                    a memoryless algorithm that does not require the maintenance  of statistics,
                    and is trivial to extend to  volumetric photon mapping.
                    Volumetric Progressive Photon Mapping. One of the main advantages of our derivation is that its extension to volumetric progressive photon mapping is trivial

                    The Gaussian  kernel leads to slightly smoother results with similar bias.

                    sample SDS paths with low probability density
                    which may even go  to zero if point light sources and pinhole cameras are allowed
                    the problem of insufficient techniques
                    Efficient handling of SDS paths
                    Our new VCM algorithm automatically  
                    computes a good mixture of sampling techniques from BPT 
                        and PPM to robustly capture the entire illumination in the scene
                    The rightmost column 
                    shows the relative contributions of the BPT and PPM techniques to the VCM image in false color. 
                    BPT [Veach and Guibas 1997] and PM/PPM [Fan et al. 2005;  
                    Hachisuka and Jensen 2011].
                    has long been demonstrated with photon mapping (PM)
                    A progressive variant has recently drawn attention with its ability to converge  with a bounded memory footprint
                    Moreover, an adaptation of these heuristics to glossy reflectance is not obvious
